I finished 31th in this ctfs, which I think is pretty good for a single player :)
Those are the challs I solved:

(I didn't solve the last pwn since its docker container escape challenge, and I don't like this type of stuff :( )
As you can see I really didn't solve even the easy stuff in the Web and Forensics category, cause I am pretty bad at them.
But I'll do my best to read writeups about challs I wasn't able to solve to become better!
